Welcome in my ContactAPI solution.

The project is working on my computer and I will probably not be able to test it on another device.

I will put some screenshots to prove that it is working on my side.

You will be able to access my API with swagger and a web client in which you can register or login then you will be able to
interact with the skill of the contact linked to your User Account.

I am not sure that you will get my users because I created them with the web client.

I made 3 :
 Fkleinclaus/ 1234Florent
 Mkleinclaus/ 1234Martial
 EMacron / 1234Emmanuel

They were all linked to the user with the same firstname. 

NB : After testing my solution on another device. You just need to write "update-database" in the Package Manager Console to initialise the database with my migrations.
You will not get any user so you will need to register and authentify to be able to use the other request.

Warning : You need to give an existing contactId to register. You can check them in the Contact table.

I hope that my solution answer to your challenge and that it will allow me to get through the recruitment process. 

Warning : You may need to modify the launchStetting.json in the MyContactsMvs project the localhost adress may not match yours

Warning : You may rebuild the local sql database and you may lose my users. If it happens,
You just need to register in the web client or in swagger. You will have to link your user to a contact. It's easier in the web client because it only proposes the existing ContactId


Thank You very much for testing my project !

Have a nice day !!
